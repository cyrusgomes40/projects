# projects
Some of the projects that I have made while I have learnt C, C++, and python.

Project 1: Identifier - This program will read a series of string tokens until end-of-file/EOF (Ctrl+D). It will determine the type of each token.

Project 2: Team Roster - This program will store roster and rating information for a sports team. Coaches rate players during tryouts to ensure a balanced team.

Project 3: Schwifty - This program reads a text file and makes it schwifty. The user supplies the filename to schwift and a string containing a sequence of the following characters to determine the schwiftiness via command-line arguments: 
L - Left shift each character in a word
R - Right shift each character in a word
I - Shift the letters' and digits' value "up" by one (wraps if necessary) and keeps other characters as the same, 
D - Shift the letters' and digits' value "down" by one (wraps if necessary) and leaves other characters as the same:

Project 4: Soduku Solver - This program is written in python and uses backtracking to solve the soduku board.

Project 5 : Huffman Tree compressor - This program is written in C++ and converts letters to huffman expressions.
