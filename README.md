Some of the projects that I have made while I have learnt C.

Project 1: Theater - As the manager of a movie theater, you are looking for ways to speed up taking inventory at the end of each week. Write a program to track the following items: Cups (5 cents each), Candy bars (30 cents each), Bags of popcorn (20 cents each), Bottled water (50 cents each).

Project 2: Fall Break - You and your friends decide to take a road trip for fall break. You all have decided to leave Tuscaloosa without planning a route; the group's word for 2021 is "spontaneity" with a motto of "No plan is the best plan.", after all. To help decide where to drive during the road trip, you decide to write a program.

Project 3: Identifier - This program will read a series of string tokens until end-of-file/EOF (Ctrl+D). It will determine the type of each token.

Project 4: Team Roster - This program will store roster and rating information for a sports team. Coaches rate players during tryouts to ensure a balanced team.

Project 5: Schwifty - This program reads a text file and makes it schwifty. The user supplies the filename to schwift and a string containing a sequence of the following characters to determine the schwiftiness via command-line arguments: 
L - Left shift each character in a word
R - Right shift each character in a word
I - Shift the letters' and digits' value "up" by one (wraps if necessary) and keeps other characters as the same, 
D - Shift the letters' and digits' value "down" by one (wraps if necessary) and leaves other characters as the same:
